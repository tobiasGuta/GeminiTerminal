# Updates

**[2/9/2025]**
- ✔ Secure API Key Input using `getpass.getpass()`
- ✔ Error Handling for API key issues, network failures, or empty responses
- ✔ Better Input Handling using `Prompt.ask()` for clean formatting
- ✔ Handles Empty Responses to avoid crashes

**[2/9/2025]**
- ✔ Added `gemini_c&p.py`: It functions similarly to the previous version but with a key improvement: it now handles pasting code across multiple lines without breaking in the terminal or causing errors in the output.
